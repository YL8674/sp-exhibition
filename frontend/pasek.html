        <h3>On Being Anxious About Digital Carbon Emissions</h3>
        <p>
          I was recently asked to discuss the ‘backstages’ of my research
          process. The prompt was a good one: there’s a lot of tangents, doubts,
          and tools that get hidden from the ‘frontstages’ of talks and
          publications—academics generally don’t like to show off their messes
          and mistakes. I, however, was increasingly keen to. I’ve lately begun
          to wonder about an emerging set of emotions and gestures that seem to
          be an inexorable part of working on the climate impacts of digital
          media. After all, we’re often stuck critiquing the very digital stages
          on which we are speaking, whether that’s Zoom, data centre archives,
          or the servers that host our words. It can make you feel like a
          cartoon character on a plank suspended over a cliff, sawing through
          the wood you’re standing on. The results can be both awkward and
          illuminating.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me start by painting a few scenes. In the first, I’m about to
          launch into a multi-day online workshop on information and
          communications technologies (ICT), art, and climate justice. The goal
          is to bring a group of technologists and media artists together to
          explore how the arts and tech sectors are currently imbricated—and
          might be reconfigured in future—as part of a wider decarbonization
          plan made for and by art workers. My job is to summarize and organize
          months of research from a winding set of empirical and interpretive
          fields. I have an extensive set of infographics and statistics to
          share, detailing the carbon footprint of everything from sending an
          email (as little as 4 grams (Richards, 2018)) to running the entire
          bitcoin network (up to 46.72 Mt/year—equivalent to the nation of
          Finland (Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, n.d.)). The ICT sector’s
          climate emissions are, I will soon urge, an urgent problem.
          Effectively addressing them will mean disrupting the aesthetic and
          operational norms of some of the largest corporations on earth.
